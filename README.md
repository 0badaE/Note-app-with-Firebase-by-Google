This is a note taking app that is synced up with google firebase as a DataBase; 

in this project, I revised, explored, and learned many new concepts that made me a better developer. 

concepts such as: 
debouncing, useEffect, onChange, onClick, seperation of concerns, firebase syntax(onSnapShot, addDoc, doc, deleteDoc, setDoc), 
setStates, React packages that help make our lives easier such as react-split, nanoid (not used in final version), setTimeout, and more!

This proeject forced me to critically think and use creative ways to solve some of my problems, for example; 
I saw that fireBase requests are not unlimited so in order to reduce the amount of requests I made a setState that takes in the text 
and then adds it into the DB every 250ms; this would reduce the amount of requests. This concept is called debouncing. 

it was fun to work on and am excited to use these tools again in future projects!
